// Include Particle Device OS APIs
#include "Particle.h"
#include "Adafruit_AS7341.h"

Adafruit_AS7341 LightSensor;

// Let Device OS manage the connection to the Particle Cloud
SYSTEM_MODE(AUTOMATIC);

// Run the application and system concurrently in separate threads
SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);

// Show system, cloud connectivity, and application logs over USB
// View logs with CLI using 'particle serial monitor --follow'
SerialLogHandler logHandler(LOG_LEVEL_INFO);

// setup() runs once, when the device is first turned on
void setup() {
  // Put initialization like pinMode and begin functions here
}

// loop() runs over and over again, as quickly as it can execute.
void loop() {
  // The core of your code will likely live here.

  // Example: Publish event to cloud every 10 seconds. Uncomment the next 3 lines to try it!
  // Log.info("Sending Hello World to the cloud!");
  // Particle.publish("Hello world!");
  // delay( 10 * 1000 ); // milliseconds and blocking - see docs for more info!
